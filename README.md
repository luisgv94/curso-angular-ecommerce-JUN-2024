<!-- GETTERS AND SETTERS -->
<!-- Using Getters and Setters in Angular Components
Getter: A getter allows you to define a method that acts like a property. When you access this property, the getter method is called automatically.
Setter: A setter allows you to define a method that is called when you assign a value to the property. This can be useful for validating or transforming the data before storing it. -->
